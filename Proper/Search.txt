agent - entity that perceives its environment and acts upon that environment  

state - a configuration of the agent and the its environment

initial state - a state where agent begins

actions - choices that can be made in a state
ACTIONS(s) returns the set of actions that can be executed in a state 's'

trasition model - a description of what state results from performing any applicable action in any state
RESULT(s, a) returns the state resulting from performing action 'a' in state 's'
 
state space - the set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions

goal - way to determine whether a given state is a goal state

path cost - numerical cost associated with a given path 

solution - a sequence of actions that leads from the initial state to a goal state 

optimal solution - a solution that has the lowest path coat among all the solutions

node {

	a data structure that keeps track of 
	- a state
	- a parent (node that generated this node)
	- an action (action applied to parent to get this node)
	- a path cost (from initial state to node)

}


Approach {

	1. Start with a frontier that contains the initial state.
	2. Repeat : 
		a. if the frontier is empty, then no solution.
		b. Remove a node from the frontier.
		c. If node contains goal state , return the solutioin. 
		d. Expand node, add resulting nodes to the frontier.

} 


Revised Approach {

	1. Start with a frontier that contains the initial state and Start with an empty explored set.
	2. Repeat : 
		a. if the frontier is empty, then no solution.
		b. Remove a node from the frontier.
		c. If node contains goal state , return the solutioin. 
		d. Expand node, add resulting nodes to the frontier if they aren't already in the frontier or the explored set.

}

A Revised Approach with frontier as stack is called DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH. 
search algorithm that always expands the deepest node in the frontier.


A Revised Approach with frontier as queue is called BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH. 
search algorithm that always expands the shallowest node in the frontier.
