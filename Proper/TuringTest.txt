The Turing Test is a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. It was proposed by the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950. The test involves a human judge engaging in natural language conversations with both a machine and a human, without knowing which is which. If the judge cannot reliably distinguish between the machine and the human based on their responses, then the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.

The test is not a definitive measure of true intelligence but rather a way to assess a machine's ability to simulate human-like intelligence in conversation. It focuses on the machine's capacity to understand and generate human-like responses, demonstrating a level of artificial intelligence that can convincingly emulate human communication. While the Turing Test has its limitations and has been subject to criticism, it remains a notable concept in the field of artificial intelligence and has influenced discussions on machine intelligence and consciousness.
